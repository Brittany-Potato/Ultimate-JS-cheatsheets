A folder I started putting together to act as a JavaScript Guide/Cheat sheet, still a wip with more to come.

Somethings includeded are:
- Methods, classes, properties etc
- Basic function variations
- Simple server blueprint with explinations on each section
- Jest example file has been started
- Different imports and installs that are common with Node.js
