A folder I started putting together to act as a JavaScript Guide/Cheat sheet, still a wip with more to come.

Different files include:

- functions.js - A variety of different functions and how to write them
- imports-installs-whatDo - Different installs and imports you may want to include in your projects and what they do
- methods-expressions-properties.js - All the different methods, objects, properties, classes etc and how to use them
- simple-server.js - A simple server blueprint for node.js and explinations on each section
- test.js - Information about jest, how to run tests and how they should look
